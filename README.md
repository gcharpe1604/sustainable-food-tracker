# Sustainable Food Tracker

This project helps users check how healthy and eco-friendly their food
choices are. The app lets you enter a barcode or type a product name,
then fetches real data from the OpenFoodFacts API. You see nutrition
grades, eco scores, CO₂ impact, additives, and a clear nutrition chart
for quick comparison.
